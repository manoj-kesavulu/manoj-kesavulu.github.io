          The project goal is to investigate user-level usage analysis in the cloud space, focusing on customer usage data mining for the cloud on/off-boarding trends, trajectories, risk assessments, tenant/cross-tenant patterns to infer usage confidence. The aim is to determine which features and functions are used, when and how, as this impacts software development costs.
          Developed an analytics approach for understanding end-users’ behavioral changes while interacting with the applications by analysing the usage data generated by the applications and the cloud systems hosting the applications.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
