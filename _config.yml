          Novel solutions to understand how users use software applications
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          The project goal is to investigate user-level usage analysis in the cloud space, focusing on customer usage data mining for the cloud on/off-boarding trends, trajectories, risk assessments, tenant/cross-tenant patterns to infer usage confidence. The aim is to determine which features and functions are used, when and how, as this impacts software development costs.
          Developed an analytics approach for understanding end-users’ behavioral changes while interacting with the applications by analysing the usage data generated by the applications and the cloud systems hosting the applications.

          Physical Location and Context-based Authentication Mechanism
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          The app collect user context information such as Physical location, Network type, device type. These information will be sent to Adaptation Manager which analyses these context information and decides appropriate security control (Authentication mechanism) using which user authenticates using the app to connect to the cloud built using OpenStack. Supports in-app fingerprint authentication.

          Created a backdoor virus and developed a novel Intrusion Detection System
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Private cloud environment is built using Eucalyptus cloud software. The attack performed is the backdoor root access to a terminal using Metasploit tool. Upon gaining access, forensic analysis (live network packet logging) is performed using various tools provided to the Linux systems and successfully determine a way to detect this particular attack and collect the evidence.

          Data Forensics Tool to Verify Evidence and Recover Lost Data
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          A C++ based tool for extracting information for examination to be used as evidence or even to recover lost data. In digital forensic analysis, Master Boot Record is captured to extract the required information of the hard disk to support the investigation process.

          Built a basic private Cloud system using OpenStack and developed a C++ tool for analysis of various scheduling algorithms (FIFO, Round-robin scheduling, LIFO, Preemptive scheduling) for the purpose of determining performance variations between the algorithms. (Part of my bachelor’s final year project to decide which algorithm would suit best for a private cloud environment)
